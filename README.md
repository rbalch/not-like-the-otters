## Development

All work happens inside the devcontainer. `uv` manages dependencies.

```bash
make check       # the single gate: controls → views --check → governance → tests
make views       # regenerate governance/views/RULES.md + registry.json
make governance  # integrity + drift check
make controls    # every controls/fitness/*.py, plus ruff and ty
make test        # pytest
```

## Governance

This repo runs a ledger governance harness. Architectural rules live as decisions under
`governance/decisions/`, each backed by an executable control under `controls/`, and CI
fails on any drift between them.

- **Agents read `governance/views/RULES.md`** — generated, live rules only. Never read
  `governance/decisions/` for rules; it retains superseded records on purpose.
- **`AGENTS.md`** is the hand-written contract: architecture, working context, and how
  work gets done here.
- **`docs/governance-harness.md`** explains why the harness exists and how to tell
  whether it is earning its keep.
- **`docs/ledger-findings.md`** is the experiment log.

Change a rule by supersession, never by edit. See the `ledger-ops` skill.
